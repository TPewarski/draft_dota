This is a tool for the MOBA Dota2. It scrapes data regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of heroes from the website dotamax.com. It uses this data to provide a tool for players to make more intelligent decisions regarding character selection.

Each remaining hero in the selection pool is given a composite rating based on the previously chosen heroes. Users can filter through heroes based on their role or farming priority. Users also have the ability to watch for certain heroes to give them easy access to the scores of their favorites.
