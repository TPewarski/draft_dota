1. Create  the option for people to listen for certain heroes. allow them to main any amount of heroes so instead of returning
 the final score of every single hero it just returns the scores of the heroes they main
 Make this toggleable between main heroes and all heroes so they still have access to the rest of the data
2. Add coop and counter pick sliders in general that normalize to 1
	2a. add a coop/counterpick slider for each hero so i dont have
	    to take into consideration weak heros etc.






Dev/Bugs
- available property is not working properly as a picked hero will show up
- set up npm start to nodemon start my server
- make the scraper more stable
	-make the scraper grab either img files or image urls
	- to make scraper more stable i want to have a boolean for each request and a timeout that will resend any requests who still have a false boolean.
